# Wi-Fi-Coverage-Optimization-for-Smart-Campus-Using-DBSCAN-and-Signal-Analysis
Wi-Fi coverage optimization using NetSpot (simulation), Python analysis, and DBSCAN clustering. Identifies dead zones and enhances the network through access point(AP) repositioning, frequency planning, beamforming, and MU-MIMO for improved coverage and performance.
